# odin-LandingPage

A project from the Odin project, this is my "first" real website try but made from looking at pictures so the code is mine but not the design.

The Idea I landed on is to make it almost like a website for my association
"SWE3 - The association for american football, flagg football and hockey"

you can find the design I copied in /img/website-desing-template/

This was a fun projcet and Flexbox is intresting, still hard to work with nested flexelements but got some stuff down.
